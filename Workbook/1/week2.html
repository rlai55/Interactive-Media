        <p>In this week's course we have been exploring lots of different types of websites such as portfolios, music, and gallery websites.</p>
        <p>We have also practiced paper prototyping through activities, and then decided on the type and design of the workbook website we will be creating.</p>

        I'm quite impressed with the Mars City Acidalia and myshrine sites, both of which use animation to give a good visual effect

        We then did the CRAZY EIGHT activity where we quickly drew 8 interfaces for mobile or pc. This activity was a great way to stimulate our creativity, and after drawing the usual designs we would then draw some of the crazier ones.

        Finally, I made a sketch of my workbook interface on a piece of paper.

        My idea was to make it look like an open book, with pictures and text as notes in the "book"!
