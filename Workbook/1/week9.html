        In the course of this week, we are still exploring physical computing in depth, adding more control units and creative coding.

        We tried to make a capacitive touch circuit.
        <br><br>
        The main principle is that the human body is naturally grounded to form a circuit.
        <br><br>
        But this is strongly related to the environment, for example, we have encountered a poor contact situation, we need to touch the ground wire by hand to make the circuit work stably.

        We also experimented with a couple of interesting applications for motion capture sensors.
        <br><br>
        Controlling the hand in the screen by capturing the movement of the hand in reality reminded me of motion capture in some game productions.

        Finally I thought about the theme of my final project, I want to make a reasonable combination of arduino and p5 to produce good outcomes.
