        In this week's course, we went to the Telstra Creative Space to get a basic understanding of physical computing through the arduino learner's kit, 
        and tried to get a few basic circuits up and running!

        By drawing a map we learnt about the components in the kit one by one. 
        <br><br>I have little to no knowledge of circuits, so this took me a bit more time to search and ask around.
        <br><br>I also explored the arduino website, where I got to know some of the components and operations that were not in the kit.

        We then tried to make an ultrasonic + buzzer circuit.
        <br><br>
        Many issues were encountered in the making, such as no response after power on, no data display, etc. 
        <br><br>
        I also tried changing the data for the ”delay“ in the code to speed up or slow down the frequency of the beeps, which was an interesting exploration.

        From this class, I learnt how interesting physical computing is and the unlimited possibilities of arduino. 
        The different combinations of connponents and codes that can be used to create a myriad of results.
