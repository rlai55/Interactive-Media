        In this week's class we explored the wonders of the arduino further, attempting to build more complex circuits that included the use of resistors,
         motors, light sensors and so on.

        The most impressive part was the creation of the 8x8 LED Matrix at the end.

        The build process took a lot of time as the wiring was very complex, but the first few attempts to run it were unsuccessful. 
        <br><br>
        After troubleshooting and solving the problems one by one it still didn't work, but the process was meaningful and deepened my understanding of the purpose of the components.

        From this class, I learnt a little deeper about physical computing applications and realised that these applications are everywhere around me and can solve many problems.
